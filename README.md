âœ¨JARVIS: A VOICE ASSISTANTâœ¨
We created this prototype using few basic python libraries.
ðŸ”´NOTE1: the code is campatible with windows but not linux
ðŸ”´Earphones must be connected to your device before running the code.

The MAIN file contains the complete code.
With this code, it is possible to ask Jarvis:
âœ¨Current weather in Bengaluru*
âœ¨Latest news
âœ¨To open websites 
âœ¨To make a goggle search
âœ¨To search on wikipedia
âœ¨To send an email**
âœ¨Jokes
âœ¨Friendly talk

ðŸ”´NOTE2:
 * only in Bengaluru
** you need to type your gmail address and password! So, this will make your current account less secure! It is recommended to create a dummy account for this reason.

ðŸ‘‰For running the MAIN file, the following libraries must be installed in python3 through CLI:
1. pyttsx3 
2. tkinter 
3. SpeechRecognition
4. datetime 
5. wikipedia
6. webbrowser
7. smtplib
8. requests
9. bs4  (BeautifulSoup)
10. pyjokes
11. googlesearch 

ðŸ‘‰On running the code, a window for authorisation pops up. for testing purpose enter the details as:
username: user1
password: password1

NOW YOU'RE READY TO GO!ðŸŽ‰
